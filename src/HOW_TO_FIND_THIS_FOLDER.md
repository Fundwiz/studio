# How to Find This Project Folder

1.  **This project's code is on your local computer.** The editor you are using is modifying these files directly on your hard drive.

2.  The reason you are deploying your old website is that you are running the `firebase deploy` command from the wrong folder (your `fundwiz-site` project).

3.  **Since you can see this file, you have found the right folder!**

4.  Now, open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to THIS exact folder, and then run the command: `firebase deploy`

It will read the correct configuration and deploy your new NiftyPulse application.
